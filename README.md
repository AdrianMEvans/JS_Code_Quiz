# The Kwiz

## About
**The Kwiz** is a webpage that is designed to test your knowledge of JS Scripts and creating dynamic webpages using JS.

There are 5 questions and the user has 75s in which to answer the questions. The process follows like this:

1. There is an opening page that explains the game and what is required. 
2. Answers must be answered within the allocated time _75seconds_.
3. For every answer that is incorrect the user is penalized by deducting 10 seconds from the remaining time.
4. The answer is verified and the following will take place
    * If the answer is correct and there is time left then the next questions is displayed
    * If the answer is incorrect then a penalty of 10seconds are placed against the time and the next question is displayed
5. If the time is = to 0 then the game ends.
6. The final score is equal to the time left at the end of question 4.
7. When the final question is answered or the time reaches 0 then the Game is Over message will be displayed. 
8. At this point the user will be asked to enter his name. 
9. Once submitted a list of all the scores from local storage will be displayed. 
10. User has option to clear Record of Scores or Restart ***The Kwiz***.
